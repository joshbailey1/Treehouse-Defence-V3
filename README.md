# Treehouse-Defence-V3
The latest version of my treehouse defence game.

In this version I added to the V2 version.
I added a subclass of Path called RandomPath which will generate a random path through the map, given any map.
I also created multiple levels containing various invaders and tower loadouts. Still allowing the user to choose where to put the tower.
I would like to make this slightly cleaner as the Game class currently has a lot of repeated bits of code (for each level).
Having seperate classes for each level would be nice.
I would also like to make it impossible to put a tower on a path or on a space where a tower already is.
Also to have the map displayed after every tower you put down and to show the towers would be ideal.
